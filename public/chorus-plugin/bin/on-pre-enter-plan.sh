CONTEXT="[Chorus Planning Workflow]
When planning implementation, follow the Chorus AI-DLC lifecycle:
1. Identify or create a Chorus Idea for this requirement
2. Create a Proposal with document drafts (PRD) and task drafts
3. Set up task dependency DAG (dependsOnDraftUuids) — frontend depends on backend API, tests depend on both
4. Submit the Proposal for admin approval
5. After approval, tasks materialize and can be claimed/assigned
Do NOT start coding without an approved Chorus Proposal unless working on an already-approved task.

When planning sub-agent work distribution:
- The Chorus Plugin auto-manages session lifecycle — do NOT plan to create sessions manually.
- Plan which Chorus task UUIDs each sub-agent will work on — that is what the prompt needs."
